# Chapter 1: Event Horizon of Trust

This project simulates a basic firewall that allows only trusted IP addresses to access the system, inspired by the event horizon concept of black holes.

## How to Run

Run the `firewall_simulation.py` script or open `firewall_simulation.ipynb` in Google Colab.

## Concept

- Trusted IPs are allowed through.
- Others are blocked.
- Demonstrates zero-trust philosophy.
