# Chapter 6 - Gravitational Waves and Technology

This project simulates a simplified gravitational wave signal and uses matched filtering to detect it in noisy data.

## Features

- Synthetic chirp-like gravitational wave generation.  
- Noise addition to simulate realistic observations.  
- Matched filter implementation for signal detection.  
- Visualization of original, noisy, and filtered signals.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- numpy  
- matplotlib  
- scipy  

## How to Run

1. Run the notebook in Google Colab or local Jupyter environment.  
2. Observe the plots showing the signal, noise, and matched filter detection.
